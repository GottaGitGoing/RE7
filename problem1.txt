// **NOTE**: assumption is that they are seperate so no redefinition
1.
int sum = 0;
for (std::vector<int>::iterator i = numbers.begin(); i!=numbers.end(); i++)
{
    sum+= *i;
}

2.
int list_sum = 0;

for (std::list<int>::iterator i = numbers.begin(); i!=numbers.end(); i++)
{
    list_sum += *i;
}

    The body of the for loop is the same, however the initialization process of
    the vector and the list are different ( different type declarations), even
    though both use the ::iterator ( each has its own implementation)

    SOLUTION: to make the two for loops look the same we would use the
    ---->  auto <---- keyword. auto determines the type declaration by 
    looking at the vector that its going to operate on and do the adjusments
    "auto"matically.

   for (auto i = numbers.begin(); i != numbers.end(); i++)
   { sum += *i;}
