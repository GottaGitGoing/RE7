1. If auto changed things at run-time it would take away a major benefit
of static languages that will reduce the risk of having to deal with
run time error.  (since run time error is harder to test for this having the
option to declare things const for example that will throw us a compile time
error if we acidentally change them) 

Having auto a compile time feauture will give us more confidence that we did 
not by mistake attempt to store something that we did not mean to.
